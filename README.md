# Manufacturing Data Modeling with Polynomial Regression 🏭📈

This project focuses on using **Polynomial Regression** to analyze and model manufacturing data. It explores how higher-order relationships between variables can help identify trends and improve production process insights.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `manufacturing.csv`: Dataset containing real-world manufacturing process data.
- `manufacturing_data_model.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with data preprocessing, visualization, and model training using polynomial regression.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python libraries.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes features such as:
- Sensor readings
- Quality control metrics
- Production rates
- Timestamps and identifiers

*(Replace with actual column names as necessary)*

## 🧠 Model Used

- **Polynomial Regression**
- Feature engineering for nonlinear trends
- Data scaling and transformation
- Evaluation metrics (R² Score, MAE, MSE)

## 📈 Results

- R² Score: *e.g. 0.95*
- Mean Squared Error: *e.g. 8.6823*
- Visualization of predicted vs actual values

## 📊 Visualization Examples

- Correlation heatmaps
- Polynomial curve fitting plots
- Residual plots and error distribution
